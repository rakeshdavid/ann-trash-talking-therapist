# UI Refresh Summary

## Completed Tasks

*   **Logo Implementation:**
    *   Replaced the original PNG logo with a crisp SVG (`rivalistalogo.svg`).
    *   Adjusted the logo dimensions to 167x73 pixels as per the design specifications.
    *   Removed the old, unused PNG logo files (`rivalistalogo.png`, `main-logo.png`).

*   **Typography and Text Styling:**
    *   Successfully configured and applied the "Barlow Condensed" font throughout the application.
    *   Implemented the multi-colored, italicized title text ("YOUR TRASH TALK THERAPY BEGINS NOW") with the correct colors and font styles.

## Pending Tasks

*   **Background Pattern Overlay:**
    *   **Goal:** Overlay the `backgroundpatterns.svg` file on top of the main background image (`background-image.jpg`).
    *   **Current Status:** The implementation is not working as expected. The background image is not loading, and therefore the pattern is not visible.
    *   **Troubleshooting Steps Taken:**
        1.  Created a `.background-container` class in `styles/globals.css` to manage the background layers.
        2.  Added a `div` with this class to `app/layout.tsx` to wrap the main content.
        3.  Verified that the file paths for both the background image and the pattern SVG are correct in the CSS.
        4.  Adjusted the opacity of the pattern overlay to ensure it's visible.
    *   **Next Step:** Investigate why the background image is not loading despite the correct file path.
