# Progress

## What Works

- The main application page renders.
- The layout is now fully responsive, adapting between mobile and desktop viewports.
- The core functionality of starting/ending a session with the HeyGen streaming avatar is in place.
- The layout is stable, with previous issues of shifting elements and inconsistent container sizes resolved.

## What's Left to Build

- While the layout is responsive, it may need further refinement for a wider range of screen sizes (e.g., tablets).
- The project brief has not been formally defined, so the current implementation is based on the initial request and may not align with broader project goals.

## Known Issues

- All known layout and alignment issues have been resolved.
