# Active Context

## Last Major Change

The entire layout of the main page (`components/InteractiveAvatar.tsx`) was restructured from a fixed-size, flexbox-based layout to a full-viewport, responsive CSS Grid layout. This was followed by a refinement pass to fix vertical alignment issues.

## Key Changes Implemented

1.  **Removed Bordered Container:** The main container that had a fixed width, height, and a visible border was removed. The layout now extends to the full edges of the viewport.
2.  **CSS Grid Implementation:** The layout is now controlled by a main CSS Grid container with three rows (header, hero, content).
3.  **Responsive Layout:** A mobile-first responsive design was implemented using Tailwind CSS prefixes (`lg:`). The UI now adapts from a single-column mobile layout to a multi-column desktop layout.
4.  **Layout Shift Fixes:**
    *   The video player area was stabilized to prevent size changes between the loading, placeholder, and active video states.
    *   The main call-to-action button's internal content was stabilized to prevent it from shifting when its text and icon content changed.
5.  **Alignment and Padding:**
    *   Removed inconsistent padding from header and content rows.
    *   Applied consistent horizontal padding (`px-6`) to all three main grid rows to ensure perfect vertical alignment of content edges.
    *   Ensured the main CTA button aligns to the right edge of its container on desktop viewports, regardless of its internal state (e.g. "End Session" vs. the initial state).
6.  **Responsive Typography:**
    *   Adjusted the main heading's font size to be smaller on mobile viewports and larger on desktop, improving readability.
    *   Set the main heading's text alignment to be left-aligned on all screen sizes per the latest feedback.
    *   Made the main CTA button full-width on mobile to align with the hero image, while retaining its original fixed width on desktop.
    *   Adjusted the CTA button's content on mobile to be a single line of text with a smaller icon to fit the constrained space, while ensuring the icon returns to its original size on desktop.
7.  **UI Polish:**
    *   Corrected the vertical alignment of text and icons within the language selector button for a more polished look.
    *   Ensured all text within the language selector button is consistently left-aligned.
    *   Vertically centered the content of the bottom row (heading and CTA button) on desktop views for better visual balance.
    *   Removed the border radius from the video player and its container elements for a sharper, edge-to-edge look.

## Next Steps

The layout is now robust, responsive, and pixel-perfect. Future work can now proceed on a stable visual foundation.
